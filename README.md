# This sample has been archived

**DEPRECATION NOTE**: ADAL v3 has been released and offers a better experience using Xamarin with iOS than this sample. 

We recommend you use the new ADAL v3 walkthrough [https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnet-native-multitarget](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnet-native-multitarget) unless you have a specific reason for requiring the binding of the native iOS library in your Xamarin application.

If you really wish to view the archived sample, please switch to the [archive](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-xamarin-ios/tree/archive) branch. This code is no longer maintained and functionality is not guaranteed.
